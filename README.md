# Sartaj Ahmad — DHK Align LLC

Founder of [DHK Align](https://dhkalign.com), a project focused on building the first Banglish ⇄ English Transliterator-tion engine.  
The goal is simple: bridge the cultural and linguistic gap for the Bengali community and those engaging with it.

## What I Am Working On
- Transliterator-tion Core (Banglish ⇄ English with cultural context)
- Free Tier (safe everyday phrases, cached in the client)
- Pro Tier (slang, profanity, dialect packs, API-key gated)
- Security: Cloudflare Worker edge shield, HMAC audit logs, nightly backups
- Payments: Stripe and BTCPay integration

## Key Repositories
- [dhkalign](https://github.com/sartu01/dhkalign) — main project
- [Docs](https://dhkalign.com) — security, privacy, roadmap
